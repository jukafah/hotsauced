          Hi! I am Steve Momcilovic, and this website is about hot sauce. This site originiated
          as a blog about hot sauces that I enjoy while learning about ruby on rails, and I have
          since decided to turn it into a type of catalog! I plan on adding new features and making this
          site something that any hot sauce connoisseur will appreciate.
